# XenHub

XenHub is the desktop and admin hub for the XENECOSYS ecosystem. It provides local control over users, message queues, encrypted bundles, DTN simulation, and hub-side coordination without depending on central cloud infrastructure.

## Project Description

XenHub acts as the operational control center for offline and low-connectivity communication. It is designed to manage local hub activity, track connected users, bundle and protect messages, and visualize data transfer across delay-tolerant paths.

The app focuses on:

- local-first hub management
- encrypted message queue handling
- user tracking and coordination
- DTN and relay visibility
- offline communication support
- desktop-oriented admin workflows

## What It Does

- Tracks users connected to the hub
- Manages message queues and encrypted bundles
- Supports DTN simulation and relay visibility
- Exposes API and SQLite-backed local data handling
- Provides a desktop-style Flutter interface for admin workflows
